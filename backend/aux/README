This directory contains scripts used to set up shared tables
in the database. 
These tables store things like gene name mapping, GO assignment,
and PPI links, which are used when loading subsequent projects. 

ppi_load.php : Loads PPI link graph, downloaded from StringDB. 
				The links are between ENSP proteins. 

load_prot_names.php: Loads ENSP names and descriptions,
                as obtained from StringDB (note we need the ones from StringDB
                since they are compatible with the PPI graph, also from StringDB)
load_hugo_tables.php : Loads HGNC names, descriptions, some aliases,
                and then ENSG mappings from Gencode.
load_stringdb_tables.php : Load ENSP and GO mappings from StringDB

FILES TO DOWNLOAD:

### From StringDB ###

all_go_knowlege_full.tsv : then extract the human piece using  egrep '^9606'

9606.protein.links.v10.5.txt :  PPI links

9606.protein.aliases.v10.5.txt : ENSP  names and descriptions

### From Genenames.org ###

hgnc_complete_set.txt : all Hugo names along with some aliases
	(ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/new/tsv/hgnc_complete_set.txt )

### From Gencode ###

The following files were used so far:
gencode.v22.annotation.gff3, gencode.v26.annotation.gff3 : ENSG names mapped to common names, mostly Hugo

As ENSG names change and are incorporated into new datasets, later releases of gencode will
be needed.
