LOADING A NEW DATASET

If it is a GDC dataset,do the following:
1. Rename expression file as "expr.csv"
2. Rename metadata json file as "metadata.json"
3. Make sure both files are in the top directory of the dataset
4. Edit the two lines indicated in load_project.php
5. Run it:  "php load_project.php |& tee out"
6. Check output to see if any parts failed
7. In case of failure, you should be able to fix using one of the sub-scripts (below)

If not a GDC dataset:
1. Set the metadata file variable to empty: $metadata_json_file=""
2. Use a custom script to load the metadata to DB (model on load_gdc_metatadata.php)
3. Run do_survival.php

If not using Ensemble gene names (ENSG), or the Ensembl version has changed:
This creates potential problems in mapping the names to ENSP proteins, which is 
necessary for the StringDB annotation. 
It may still succeed if the gene names are Hugo-like, as many name mappings are already
stored in the DB. 

If the problem is updated Ensembl names, then get the new mappings from Gencode 
and use aux/load_hugo_tables.php to load them. 

If names can't be addressed this way you may need to custom-load additional
mapping data. You can also manually create the table gene.map which is
used by load_project.php, but it is better to put the mapping data
in the DB and then let the script create this file.

SUB-SCRIPTS

load_gdc_metadata.php : load survival data from GDC json file

do_survival.php : do survival comps (using R scripts and the previously loaded metadata)

do_stringdb_annot.php :  get GO,Kegg enrichment from StringDB (relies on prior mapping of genes to ENSP proteins)

load_expr.php : load expression table (for heatmaps) and do logz conversion

##################################################################

OTHER SCRIPTS

delete_project.php : delete project by name

schema.php : load the database schema

util.php : various helper functions

db.php : database helper functions

Initializing the gene name tables, GOs etc: (these are not associated to a specific project)

(See further info in aux/README)

1. aux/load_prot_names.php to load all the ENSP names and descriptions, 
		as obtained from StringDB (note we need the ones from StringDB
		since they are compatible with the PPI graph, also from StringDB)
2. aux/load_hugo_tables.php : load the true HGNC names, descriptions, some aliases,
		and then ENSG mappings from Gencode. 
3. aux/load_stringdb_tables.php : load ENSP and GO mappings from StringDB
4. aux/load_ppi.php : load StringDB PPI links
