    <h1>How to navigate and understand results on this site</h1>

    <h2>Quick start guide</h2>

    <p>
        To get a quick idea of the analysis here, click on <a href="http://corex.isi.edu/index.html?opt=dset">Datasets</a> and
        then select a study, for instance "LUAD_default" (Lung Adenocarcinoma,
        the data and abbreviations all come from the <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov">Genomics Data Commons</a>).
        The first screen summarizes some things about the dataset: the source of the data and some of the discovered
        factors that are predictive of long-term survival, along with the annotations of these factors according to the
        Gene Ontology (GO) database.
    </p>

    <p>
        To look at the results in more depth, click "Explore this dataset" at the top of the page. This reveals
        different frames for inspecting the results in detail. Start by looking at the "Survival" pane. For this example,
        the "single factor" dropdown shows the factor that most predicts survival as factor 159. Clicking on it shows
        the survival curves for different risk strata. To learn more about factor 159, we go to the "Heatmap" and choose
        159 from the dropdown menu. We see a group of genes associated with factor 159 that are all highly correlated (or anti-correlated).
        Next, we can switch Frame1 to "annotation" and again select factor 159. This shows the top annotations for
        this group of genes along with their significance.

    <h1>Technical notes</h1>

    <p>
        In the process of designing this analysis pipeline and applying it to many new datasets, we learned some
        new lessons that did not appear in the original paper on ovarian cancer. First of all, the appearance of
        zero counts in the data had a drastic deleterious effect on results. We screen out genes/columns that contain
        zero counts. We also did this in the original study, but there were not as many genes with zero counts in that case.
        Secondly, while the TCGA data (used in the published study) has in principle been migrated to GDC, we have noticed
        significant deviations in the two datasets. For instance, some counts that were nonzero in TCGA were zeroes in the
        GDC data. This appears to be related to differing gene definitions, please contact GDC if you would like to
        understand the detailed differences in datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
    Results on this site use the increasingly standard "upper quantile" normalization. The original study used standard
        normalization. We did not see significant differences when comparing results.
        The settings for running CorEx are otherwise identical to those used in the original study.
