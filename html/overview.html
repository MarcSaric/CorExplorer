    <h1>Overview and quick start guide</h1>

    <p>
        The goal of this website is to discover patterns in gene expression data that
        can help in identifying new targets and treatments for different cancer types.
        </p>
    <p>
        To get a quick idea of the analysis here, click on <a href="http://corex.isi.edu/index.html?opt=dset">Datasets</a> and
        then select a study, for instance "LUAD_default" (Lung Adenocarcinoma,
        the data and abbreviations all come from the <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov">Genomics Data Commons</a>).
        The first screen summarizes some things about the dataset: the source of the data and some of the discovered
        factors that are predictive of long-term survival, along with the annotations of these factors according to the
        Gene Ontology (GO) database.
    </p>

    <p>
        To look at the results in more depth, click "Explore this dataset" at the top of the page. This reveals
        different frames for inspecting the results in detail. Start by looking at the "Survival" pane. For this example,
        the "single factor" dropdown shows the factor that most predicts survival as factor 159. Clicking on it shows
        the survival curves for different risk strata. To learn more about factor 159, we go to the "Heatmap" and choose
        159 from the dropdown menu. We see a group of genes associated with factor 159 that are all highly correlated (or anti-correlated).
        Next, we can switch Frame1 to "annotation" and again select factor 159. This shows the top annotations for
        this group of genes along with their significance.

        Studies describing the methods are
        in <a href="http://corex.isi.edu/index.html?opt=pub">Publications</a> and the code used to generate these results
        is available in <a href="http://corex.isi.edu/index.html?opt=dl">Downloads</a>.
