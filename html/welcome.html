    <h1>Welcome to the CorEx portal for gene expression analysis!</h1>

    <p>
        This website began as an extension of work applying the CorEx machine
        learning algorithm to gene expression data from ovarian cancer tumors as
        presented in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-017-0245-6">this paper</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        CorEx searches for statistical patterns of gene expression present in subgroups
        of patients. These subgroups can then be mined for significance in terms of
        survival or database annotations. The primary goal in the original article
        was to enable meaningful personalized expression profiling for the purposes
        of both target discovery and treatment selection in ovarian cancer patients.

        This website is intended to facilitate the rapid analysis and interpretation
        of gene expression data for large numbers of tumors across various cancer types.
        Here you can interactively view and explore the original published dataset,
        and eventually data for other cancers as well. Additionally, we plan to add
        the ability to upload custom tumor data in the future. If you are interested in seeing
        results from a specific GDC study, please let us know.
