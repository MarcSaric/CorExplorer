<b>Welcome to the CorEx portal for gene expression analysis!</b>
</p>
<p>
This website began as an extension of work applying the CorEx machine 
learning algorithm to gene expression data from ovarian cancer tumors as 
presented in Bio Med Gen. REF
</p>
<p>
CorEx searches for statistical patterns of gene expression present in subgroups 
of patients. These subgroups can then be mined for significance in terms of 
survival or database annotations. The primary goal in the original article 
was to enable meaningful personalized expression profiling for the purposes 
of both target discovery and treatment selection in ovarian cancer patients. 
</p><p>
This website is intended to facilitate the rapid analysis and interpretation 
of gene expression data for large numbers of tumors across various cancer types. 
Here you can interactively view and explore the original published dataset, 
and eventually data for other cancers as well. Additionally, we plan to add 
the ability to upload custom tumor data in the future.
